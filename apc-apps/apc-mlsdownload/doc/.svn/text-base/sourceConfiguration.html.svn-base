The most difficult part about configurating this package is making a connection
to the MLS server.  Even with standards like RETS there are enough variations
between server vendors to cause frustration. A configuration file is used to 
specify how the package communicates with the MLS server and specifies options
for your connection.

<br/><br/>

<var>Source</var> configuration files are plain text format and can be found at
<a href="./installDistribution.html#installation_directory">{<var>INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY</var>}</a>
/ 
<a href="./installDistribution.html#sources_directory">{<var>SOURCES_DIRECTORY</var>}</a> 
/{<var>SITE_NAME</var>}.  The <var>SITE_NAME</var> is specified when a 
<var>Source</var> is    
<a href="./createSource.html">defined</a>
.  If you have multiple Sources defined, there will be more than one file
in the <var>SOURCES_DIRECTORY</var>.  It is a good idea to keep a backup of
<var>Source</var> configurations in this directory. 

<br/><br/>

You need a Source defined for each MLS you would like to connect to.  If you
only plan to connect to a single MLS you will need one of these files, even 
if you plan to support multiple Broker/Agent sites.  The settings shipped with
the distribution will connect to the demonstration server operated by the   
<a href="http://www.realtors.org/crt">Center for REALTOR&reg; Technology</a>
, a division of the National Association of REALTORS&reg;. 

<br/><br/>

As this package matures, attempts are being be made to "auto-detect" as many of these
variables as possible.

<br/><br/>

This file has different <var>sections</var> that are used to divide configuration 
information into logical groups:

<ul>

<li><a href="#connection">Connection</a> 
for connecting to a RETS Server
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><a href="#auto_detection">Auto Detection</a>

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
</li>

This section identifies which RETS server you are connecting to.  You will
need to obtain the information for these settings from you service provider.
The distribution provides defaults that allow you to connect to the
demonstration server operated by CRT.

<br/><br/>

Some RETS servers require a special "User-Agent" setting.  User-Agent 
headers are part of the HTTP protocol and allow a server to identify the
software package being used to access the server.  Some servers use this header
to identify users.  The User-Agent header has two components and is structured
in the following format:

<xmp>APPLICATION/VERSION</xmp>

If you were given a User-Agent value by you service provider, supply the 
information in the connection panel.

<ul>

<li><b>RETS_SERVER_ACCOUNT</b> - The name of the RETS account.  Defaults to 
"Joe". 
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><b>RETS_SERVER_PASSWORD</b> - The password of RETS account.  Defaults to
"Schmoe".
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><b>RETS_SERVER_URL</b> - The URL of the RETS server.  Defaults to 
"http://demo.crt.realtors.org:6103/rets/login".
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><b>RETS_CLIENT_PASSWORD</b> - The password of RETS client required by some
RETS servers.  You normally will not need to set this. Defaults to NULL or "".
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><b>RETS_DEFAULT_PORT</b> - The port to use if the RETS server is not
specific during its reply to a login.  The RETS specification identifies 6103
as the default port, but in practice, many providers use 80.  This is probably
because the HTTP default is 80.  Defaults to "80".
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><b>APPLICATION</b> - The network identification (name) of this client for
use within the HTTP protocol.  If you change this, make sure that you only use
one word.  Defaults to "VieleRETS".
<br/><br/>
</li>

<li><b>VERSION</b> - Part of the HTTP client identifcation that signifies
version number.  You can leave this blank if the User-Agent supplied to you by
the MLS is not in the form APPLICATION/VERSION. Defaults to "1.1".
<br/><br/>
</li>

<li><b>KEEP_ALIVE_SERVER</b> - Specify whether the RETS server supports
keep-alive tcp sockets.  Setting this to "true" will result in avoiding 
setting up a new tcp socket between this package and the RETS server for each
communication and will result in higher performance.  Not all RETS servers 
support this capability.  If you are not sure, leave it as "false".  Defaults 
to "false".
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><b>ENCODE_REQUESTS</b> - Specify whether the RETS server supports
requests that are URL Encoded. Typically this is set to "true".  If you 
use the default value and have problems executing queries that have values
with spaces (like area="Hidden Oaks") then try setting this to "false".
Defaults to "true".
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><b>POST_REQUESTS</b> - Specify whether the  you want to use POST or GET
style HTTP requests.  Some older servers have a problem with long GET style
requests and even construct Digest Authentication incorrectly with GET.  If
you are trying to return more than 60 fields for any one listing and the 
package fails, but bringing back 10 fields works, then you might want to 
leave this set to "true".  Defaults to "true".
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><b>STANDARD_SERVER_RESPONSE</b> - Some servers that claim to be RETS 
compliant actually produce non-standard XML data.  Their responses are not
well formed and cannot be parsed with standard XML parsers as the RETS
Standard intended.  If you are trying to configure one of these sources,
set this to "false".  This setting is new to Version 2.0.  The default is 
"true".  
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><b>SERVER_TIME_DIFFERENCE</b> - The difference in hours between your
location and the location of the server.  This is handy for helping the
time-based "Updates Only" feature handle the concept of midnight.
</li>
 
</ul>

The following setting is auto-detected by the package and stored in the
configuration file.
<ul>

<li><b>DETECTED_SERVER_NAME</b> - The name of the server derived from the HTTP 
headers.  This value is set by the server you are connected to.
</li>

Although the package has the ability to auto detect capabilities of the server,
sometimes it is necessary to change these values.  The following values can only
be changed by resetting the <var>Source</var> though because they define the 
context:

<ul>

<li><a name="selection_resource"><b>SELECTION_RESOURCE</b></a>
- The RETS resource to use for a query.  The RETS
standard identifies "Property" as the common name for this. 
This setting is used for both
<a href="#dependents">Text and Media</a> 
queries.
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><a name="selection_class"><b>SELECTION_CLASS</b></a>
- The RETS class to use for a query.  The RETS 
standard does not identify a common name.  This setting is highly dependent on
your service provider.  The demo server that CRT opertates has data in only
one class, "RES".
This setting is used for 
<a href="#dependents">Text</a> 
queries.
</li>

</ul>
 
The following values can be changed withing the defined context:

<ul>

<a name="unique_key"><b>UNIQUE_KEY</b></a>
- The name of the data element that is the unique key for
the data.  This is typically the listing number for property data.  This value 
is highly site dependent.
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><a name="standard_names"><b>DETECTED_STANDARD_NAMES</b></a>
- If the server you are using supports RETS
Standard Names, this value is set to "true".  This setting affects the values
for the following 
<a href="#dependents">Dependent</a> 
settings:

<ul>

<li>OWNERSHIP_VARIABLE</li>
<li>QUERY_ITEMS</li>
<li>DETAIL_ITEMS</li>
<li>GALLERY_ITEMS</li>
<li>SUMMARY_ITEMS</li>

</ul>

<br/>
</li>
 
<li><a name="max_rets_version"><b>DETECTED_MAXIMUM_RETS_VERSION</b></a>
- The maximum version of RETS that 
this server supports.  This value can be 1.0, 1.5 or 1.7.
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><a name="compact_decoded"><b>COMPACT_DECODED_FORMAT</b></a>
- If the server you are using supports RETS
Standard COMPACT-DECODED format, you should set this value to "true".  When
set to "true", data fields that are comma separated lists (like "features")
will be expanded to a more verbose form by the server. If you set this value to
"false", your site will be asked to supply RETS COMPACT format.  This package 
does not support RETS STANDARD_XML format yet.
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><a name="pagination"><b>PAGINATION</b></a>
- Some servers do not support enough of the RETS standard 
to allow query results to be packaged into pages for easier viewing.
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><a name="offset_adjust"><b>OFFSET_ADJUSTMENT</b></a>
- If the server interprets the RETS Offset as being "n-1",
set this value to "true".  You can tell if this is happening when the first
listing in the first batch is missing.  Specifically, servers that 
use "n-1" logic interpret an Offset=10 to mean the eleventh record because it
begins counting at zero instead of one.  For "n-1" servers set this to -1. A 
"n" logic server would interpret Offset=10 to mean the tenth record because it
begins counting at one.  Most RETS servers are the "n" logic variety.  For "n"
servers set this to 0. Auto-Detection attempts to determine the server type 
("n" or "n-1").  
Defaults to "0".
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><a name="media_multipart"><b>MEDIA_MULTIPART</b></a>
- If the server supports the RETS multi-part option,
set this value to "true".  When set to true, a single request to the server
returns all information about the images for a property.  This setting is
highly site dependent and only relevant if the MEDIA_LOCATION parameter is set
to "true".  Defaults to "true".
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><a name="media_location"><b>MEDIA_LOCATION</b></a>
- If the server supports the RETS Location option, 
set this value "true".  When set to "true", the location from the RETS server 
is assumed to be a direct URL to the media.  When set to "false", a proxy
specified by the
<a href="#media_proxy">MEDIA_PROXY</a>
setting is used to serve the image to the browser.  Defaults to "true".
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><a name="media_zero"><b>MEDIA_LIST_ZERO_START</b></a>
- If the server starts counting images at one,
set this value to "true".  This setting is only relevant if either the 
MEDIA_MULTIPART or MEDIA_LOCATION parameters (see above) are set to "false".  
If the server starts counting images at zero, set this value to "false".  
Defaults to "false".
</li>
 
<li><a name="non_standard_media"><b>NON_STANDARD_MEDIA</b></a>
- Some RETS servers do no support the RETS GetObject Transaction but do make
images available through a Search transaction.  The package identifies these
servers during Auto-Detection and sets this parameter.
Defaults tp "false".
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><a name="non_standard_media_resource"><b>NON_STANDARD_MEDIA_RESOURCE</b></a>
If you are trying to connect to a RETS server that supports media in a
non-standard way (see NON_STANDARD_MEDIA), this parameter holds the name of the
Resource that can be used to access images.
Defaults to NULL.
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><a name="non_standard_media_class"><b>NON_STANDARD_MEDIA_CLASS</b></a>
If you are trying to connect to a RETS server that supports media in a
non-standard way (see NON_STANDARD_MEDIA), this parameter holds the name of the
Class that can be used to access images.
Defaults to NULL.
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><a name="non_standard_media_type"><b>NON_STANDARD_MEDIA_TYPE</b></a>
If you are trying to connect to a RETS server that supports media in a
non-standard way (see NON_STANDARD_MEDIA), this parameter holds the name of the
Type that can be used to access images.  This value is site dependent so you
will have to check with your service provider.
Defaults to NULL.

This section contains parameters that you might find useful if you anticipate
processing thousands of rows or if you are continually running out of memory.
If neither of these conditions is not present, you should leave these settings
at their default setting which leave streaming turned off.  If you use this
capability, "pagination" will not be possible.

<br/>

<ul>

<li><b>STREAM_PROCESSING</b> - Specify whether you would like to perform
"on-the-fly" rendering of the listings.  Set this to "true" if you anticipate
processing result sets with thousands of listings.  If you plan to use this
project as the basis for an application that does something other than 
creating HTML pages, you might find it handy to set this to "true".  If you
run out of memory while processing records, you should set this to "true".
This is a new setting as of Version 2.0. Defaults to "false".
<br/><br/>
</li>
 
<li><b>SIMULTANEOUS_LOGINS</b> - This setting is only relavent if you set 
STREAM_PROCESSING to "true".  To accomplish streaming, this package needs to 
either issue an embedded session or a concurrent transaction.  Embedded
sessions require that the server support more than one session with the same
login.  Many older RETS Servers support this, but for security reasons, some
newer RETS Servers do not.  The reason that the newer servers do not support
multiple session with the same login is to discourage the practice of
"sharing logins".  This practice is looked down upon in all security circles.
Setting this parameter to "true" allows older, less secure RETS Servers to
perform streaming.  If you require streaming, you should try to work with
servers that support "simultaneous sessions".  This is a new setting as of
Version 2.0. Defaults to "false".

- This setting controls the handling of RETS Servers that
do not support the Location option of the RETS GetObject transaction.  In these
cases, a "proxy" is supplied with the distribution to take advantage of 
multi-threading in the browser.  This proxy is located withing the distribution
by default.  If you would like to move it to another location, you should
specify the "web" address to use here.  Do not use the location of the 
directory.  You should also use the script found in the   
<a href="./installDistribution.html#extras_directory">extras directory</a> 
called "movable_media_proxy.php" as a sample of the proxy.  You will need to
modify this file to point at this distribution.

<li><b>MEDIA_VALIDATE</b> - This setting will validate if media actually exists
on the server BEFORE the page is rendered by the browser.  It will slow down
page generation significantly because images will be requested twice.  If your
server has many missing images, it may be helpful to turn this to "true".  On
the other hand, if your MLS has a pretty good fill of images, you might want to
turn this to "false".  Defaults to "false".

This section contains settings for forms-based prompts for the consumer.
You will need some knowledge or the RETS DMQL specifcation language if you want
to define complex prompts.  There is a built-in governor that will only allow
a maximum of 99 listings to be returned.  This feature eases the burden on RETS
servers for "wide open" searches.

<br/><br/>

The distribution has an example of defining forms.  The definition looks like 
this:

<xmp>define("QUERY_ITEMS","ListingID,ListPrice,StreetName,PostalCode");</xmp>

In this case, a form with four fields would be generated.  Without further 
definition, each of these fields would be generated as a text entry that 
need to match exactly with the values on the RETS Server.  For example, if
the consumer entered the field for "StreetName"as "Main Street", only listings
on that street would be returned.

<br/><br/>

This functionality is so basic and most searches conducted by the consumer 
are actually performed as ranges.  I will now discuss how to specify ranges.
At the bottom of the definition file, arrays are defined for this purpose.
An example would be:

<xmp>$ListPrice_FORM=array("Less than $150,0000"=>"150000-",
                           "Between $150,000 and $200,000"=>"150000-200000",
                           "Greater than $200,000"=>"200000+");
</xmp>

This means that the "ListPrice" ($ListPrice_FORM) field has three options:
<ol>
<li>Less than $150,000</li>
<li>Between $150,000 and $200,000</li>
<li>Greater than $200,000</li>
</ol>

If there is a statement that looked like this:
<xmp>$ListingStatus_FORM=array("VISIBLE"=>"A");
</xmp>

It specifies that the query should set the defualt for "ListStatus"
($ListStatus_FORM) to "A".  The key work "VISIBLE" allows the field to
be displayed to the consumer.  If you set this to any other value, like
"DEFAULT", the option will not appear to the consumer.

<br/><br/>

You must be sure that the definitions refer to elements that are part of 
the "QUERY_ITEMS" definition.
